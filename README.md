# 🎮 ** [DEPRECATED] Epic Fight: Controlify**

A mod that integrates [**Epic Fight**](https://modrinth.com/mod/epic-fight) with
[**Controlify: Forgified (Unofficial)**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controlify-forgified-unofficial)
for full controller support.

This addon is the result of collaboration with the Epic Fight team.

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED (READ THIS SECTION BEFORE DOWNLOADING)

Starting from **Epic Fight 21.13.3.2 (NeoForge 1.21.1)** and **Epic Fight 20.13.5 (Forge 1.20.1)**,  
this mod’s functionality is **already built-in** to Epic Fight and is fully supported natively.

Installing this addon on these or newer versions of Epic Fight may cause **undefined or buggy behavior**.

All sections in this page are likely **outdated** and do not reflect the latest Epic Fight X Controlify behavior.

## 🚀 Future Direction

We **recommend** using the **latest Epic Fight NeoForge** (1.21.1 or newer) with Controlify.  
If you’re still on legacy Forge, you can keep using it until Epic Fight addons migrate to NeoForge.

## ⚔️ **Epic Fight Actions**

The Controlify integration supports:

- **Phantom Ascent** (double-jump)
- **Demolition Leap** (or any chargeable skill)
- Epic Fight attacks without vanilla attacks in Epic Fight mode
- Weapon innate skills and tooltips in the inventory GUI
- **Any Guard Skill**
- Preventing accidental item switching or offhand swapping during combat in Epic Fight mode
- **Dodge** and **Step** skills — also compatible with custom dodge skills from Epic Fight addons; as long as they don't
  override the vanilla Epic Fight behavior
- **Knockdown wake-up** skill
- Controlify-supported keybinds with descriptions and a radial menu for multiple actions:
    * Switching to vanilla mode
    * Opening the skill editor or skill tree
- **Skill Editor** and **Skill Tree** screens — with enhanced navigation support

## 📦 **Required Dependencies**

Make sure you have these mods installed:

- [**Epic Fight**](https://modrinth.com/mod/epic-fight)
- [**Controlify: Forgified (Unofficial)**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controlify-forgified-unofficial)
- [YetAnotherConfigLib (YACL)](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) (required by Controlify)

## 🔧 **Compatibility**

### ✅ Fully Supported and Compatible Mods

- [Epic Fight](https://modrinth.com/mod/epic-fight)
- [Epic Fight: Skill Tree](https://modrinth.com/mod/epic-fight-skill-tree)
- [Epic Fight - Sword Soaring](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sword-soaring)

---

### ⚠️ Not Yet Compatible Mods

- [Epic Fight - Invincible Lib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epic-fight-invincible) — This mod registers
  custom keybinds and input handling, even for basic attacks, so it’s currently unsupported.  
  We have [submitted a GitHub pull request](https://github.com/GaylordFockerCN/EpicFight-Invincible/pull/2) to the
  author to address this issue.

---

### 🧩 Minor Incompatibilities

- [Weapons of Miracles](https://modrinth.com/mod/weapons-of-miracles) — This mod has custom jump input handling when
  using the *Natural Sprinter* skill, but aside from that, everything works as expected.

## 🐞 **Bug Reports**

Any issues when using this unofficial addon **should not be reported** to the Epic Fight or Controlify projects.  
Please [**submit them to this GitHub repository**](https://github.com/EchoEllet/epicfight-controlify/issues) instead.
