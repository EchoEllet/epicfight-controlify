# Workaround

The file [icon.png](icon.png) is a temporary workaround for  
this [Controlify issue](https://github.com/isXander/Controlify/issues/700),  
which occurs only in NeoForge builds.

The project maintainers should consider removing the `fabric-resource-loader-v0` folder entirely  
once the issue is resolved in future updates.
